Are you annoyed with software maintenance? If so, read on.

Qup, pronounced cup, is software maintenance simplified. Building and preparing
numerous releases is boring and time-consuming. If a software release includes
a single change, why download an entire bundle? Why create an entire bundle?

BiblioteQ requires Debian Linux, Mac, PowerPC Linux, Raspberry Pi Linux, and
Windows releases. Five bundles! As a developer, it's easier to build the
individual release files and upload them. Zero bundles.

Developers:
<ol>
<li>Compile and deploy only necessary files.</li>
<li>Create smartly-labeled files.</li>
</ol>

People:
<ol>
<li>Download Qup.</li>
<li>Select a local product.</li>
<li>Select a remote repository.</li>
<li>The software, Qup, will download the files and copy them locally.</li>
<li>You are now current!</li>
<li>Zero bundles.</li>
</ol>
